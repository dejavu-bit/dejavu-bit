Travel and technology are my passions. Most of my time, I dedicate myself to learn and teach others. Thatâ€™s what I call it my passion. I used to aspire to do great and lovely things with it. Iâ€™ve since realized that I prefer to interact with ideas rather than make pretty expressions of them. I write about mainly networking, Evolving Network Technologies and roughly anything else that interests me at a particular stage.

The best part about being myself is learning all of the great new technologies, and working with a community of people who are all passionate about learning, and just generally being a part of a culture that values learning the way I do. I love sitting down and working through an involved or complex topic so that I can competently speak about it on public.

And if that wasnâ€™t enough to keep me busy â€” Iâ€™m also the father of 2 year old Reyansh.
